This project shows how to use a simple perceptron with two hidden layers to build model for MNIST images recognition.  
There are also callbacks used - checkpoint callback to save model's checkpoints during the training and tensorboard
callback needed for correct TensorBoard model analysis and view.  
After model training there is the performance check and model save to the /my_model directory for the next loading and usage.
