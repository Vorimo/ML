This project demonstrates several way to classify the digits visual data based on the training set.  
Performed models are:
 - linear classifiers with SGD training
 - k-nearest neighbor classifier
 - linear support vector classifier  
System actions:
 - reads the data
 - splits it onto 2 sets: training and test one (80%/20%)
 - prepares data depends on the model
 - feeds prepared data to models
 - shows predictions/errors
